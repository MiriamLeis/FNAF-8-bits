# Five Nights At Freddy's 8-bits
***********************************************************************************
### *Eleven cameras. Six Nights. Four animatronics. Two security doors. One office. Will you survive?*
***********************************************************************************

##### Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds!

##### But... Somehow, the robot's behavior has become... How could i explain it?... Unpredictable at night, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.

##### From your small office you must watch the security cameras. But be careful with the battery because you have a limited amount of it (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means that if you run out of energy at the middle of the night, no more security doors and light!

##### If something goes wrong - namely if Freddy and his friends are not in their right places, I recommend you to find them in the monitor and protect yourself in case of... well, don't worry, everything will be alright.

##### Good luck in your watch in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!

## About the game

##### The player must *survive* all the nights, avoiding the animatronic's attacks using the cameras (to keep an eye on them), the security doors (to stop their access into the office) and the lights.

##### As the night pass, the energy available will run out. Besides, the use of the different elements will make that the remaining *battery decrease* faster. Because of that must be careful about the resources.

##### There are *four animatronics*: Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy. Each one has their own behaviour (pattern, attacks, difficulty) and they will appear depending on the player's actions.

##### Each night the player will receive calls from an old security guard of the establishment that will give advices and hints of the game's lore to the player.
